# Reference-genome-based-RNA-seq-Data-Analysis-Project
This project involved analysing bulk RNA-seq cancer data.

## Dataset
The data set for this project was obtained from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE262226.

The dataset GSE262226 involves high-throughput sequencing analysis on triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT549) treated with Lespedeza bicolor root extract. The aim was to investigate changes in gene expression associated with cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion after treatment with Lespedeza bicolor root, with the goal of identifying potential target genes.

The experiment involved treating MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells with Lespedeza bicolor root extract at a concentration of 5 Âµg/mL for 48 hours. Gene expression profiling was conducted using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform for comprehensive analysis.

The dataset contains four samples:

GSM8160836: Control group of MDA-MB-231 cells

GSM8160837: Lespedeza bicolor root treated group of MDA-MB-231 cells

GSM8160838: Control group of BT549 cells

GSM8160839: Lespedeza bicolor root treated group of BT549 cells
